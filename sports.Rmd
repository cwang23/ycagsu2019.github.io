“Hello everyone! If you haven’t already met me, I’m Hana Lord from the 4th cohort. During my time at YCA, sports have been a constant source of joy in my life. I fully believe in the clichéd potential of sports to instill confidence, strengthen friendships, and overall enrich our lives. Intra-school tournaments and sports days also present YCA students with some of our best opportunities to represent ourselves to the broader PKU community. As the former captain of the women’s football team however, I am also well-aware of the lack of coordination and funding for school sports activities. As the first Director of Sports, I hope to collaborate with the office, other GSU members, and sports team captains to support our student-athletes. Specifically, I will work to ensure funding for tournament fees and shareable equipment (which athletes have had to cover by themselves in the past) and help coordinate sports events. Having participated in women’s soccer, women’s basketball, and both fall and spring sports days, I am familiar with the structure of sports events and their importance to YCA students. With happier, healthier “global leaders” comes a brighter tomorrow. Vote Hana for Director of Sports!”
